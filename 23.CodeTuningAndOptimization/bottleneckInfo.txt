In OrbitsCalculator.cs, there is private method - EarthRotation() on line 94, which causes the slow performance due to unnecessary for iteration, which not only is needless, but also having a decimal to double convertion.

Solution -> deleting the for iteration, leaving the method in the following condition :

 private void EarthRotation()
        {
	    EarthRotationAngle = 360 * Days / EarthRotationPeriod;
            Update("EarthRotationAngle");
        }
